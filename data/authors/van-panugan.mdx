My name is Van Philip M. Panugan, and Iâ€™m a dedicated web developer with a passion for creating innovative and scalable digital solutions.

I have hands-on experience as a Web Developer Intern at Empath, where I streamlined DevOps workflows using AWS and GitHub Actions, and as a part-time Website Developer at DOST-PTRI, where I managed dynamic websites and AWS-based database infrastructure.

I specialize in Python, JavaScript, AWS, and Next.js, focusing on automation, optimization, and enhancing user experience through CI/CD pipelines, database management, and collaborative development.

I am currently working at Ylang Labs, where I contribute to open-source projects and help build tools that empower developers through hands-on learning and collaborative development.
