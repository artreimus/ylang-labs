My name is Ezekiel J. Mariano, I graduated from Mapua University with a Degree in Computer Engineering. I specialize on Software Development and mostly work and is interested on Front-End designing with a recent interest in the field of AI development and how it can make work and creating more efficient.

I have experience working as a software developer as an intern on Empath in which NextJS react framework is used to work on both front-end and back-end tasks. I also have experience working on data management and data visualization through the use of Tableau from my internship opportunity in APC by Schneider Electric.

Currently working as part of the Ylang Labs teams at the same time as I focus on learning more about AI through exercises, practices and collaborative work.

I am currently experienced with working using Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python, React, and NextJS. I am currently expanding my learnings specifically on AI as well as Python and is interested in learning more about back-end programming.
